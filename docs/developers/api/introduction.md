Pandabase HTTP API allows developers to interact programmatically with their resources using HTTP requests.

The API supports any programming language or framework that can send HTTP
requests.

You can use the commands listed below with `curl` by providing your token.

## API Basics

| Environment | URL                                | Protocols           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Production  | `https://api.pandabase.io`         | HTTP/1.1-2 over TLS |

## Additional Information

- All endpoints are accessible under the specified URLs.
- The API follows the REST architecture principles.
- Both production and sandbox environments support HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols.
- All communications are secured using TLS (Transport Layer Security).

### Domains and IP addresses

<Callout type="warn">

Only `HTTPS` requests are allowed, any requests made with `HTTP` will be
redirected.

</Callout>

### Content Type

All requests must be encoded as JSON with the Content-Type: `application/json`
header. If not otherwise specified, responses from the Pandabase API, including
errors, are encoded exclusively as JSON as well.

### Versioning

The Pandabase API uses a hybrid versioning system that combines major versions with date-based increments to ensure stability while providing continuous improvements.

**How It Works**

1. **Major Versions**: Released when there are breaking changes that require code updates
   - Breaking changes include endpoint restructuring, renamed fields, or removed functionality
   - Each major version is maintained separately to give you time to migrate
   - Current version: **V2** (released March 7, 2026)

2. **Date-Based Increments** (YYYY/MM/DD): Added to major versions for non-breaking updates
   - Non-breaking changes include new features, additional fields, bug fixes, and performance improvements
   - Format: `YYYY/MM/DD-v2` (e.g., `2026/03/09-v2`)
   - These updates are backward compatible within the same major version

**Version Header**

Every API response includes the current version in the `X-Version` header, allowing you to track which version you're using.

### Request IDs

Every API response includes the following headers:

| Header         | Description                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-Request-ID` | Unique request identifier for tracking and troubleshooting |
| `X-Version`    | Current API version in `YYYY/MM/DD-v2` format              |

If you encounter an issue with our service, providing the `X-Request-ID` to our support team will expedite the resolution process.
